# Project Description

This project is a coded version of a Figma design page, developed as part of an interview task to demonstrate skills in responsive web development. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a responsive layout. The purpose of this project is to translate a given design into a functional webpage while maintaining its aesthetic and ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Key Features:
- **Responsive Navigation Menu**: A hamburger menu is implemented for smaller screens to ensure the navigation adapts seamlessly to different device sizes.
- **Scrollable Image Section**: A dynamic image container with left and right scroll buttons allows for navigation through a set of products or images.
- **Content Section**: Divided into two parts, the left section provides a list of topics, while the right section dynamically displays images fetched from an API, along with descriptions.
- **Footer**: The footer is divided into three parts: branding on the left, links to additional resources in the center, and social media icons on the right. It includes a line separating the main content from the address and copyright notice.

The project is a showcase of front-end skills and the ability to convert Figma designs into functional, user-friendly webpages.
